## Technologies used

This project follows a custom structure that combines the following:

- [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API
- [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) as the view layer of the app
- [`React-query`](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/overview) for data-fetching library for React
- [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for extending JavaScript to be typed
- [`Material-ui`](https://mui.com/) as the UI library

... and some [more stuff](./package.json).

### React

We use React as a framework for building & rendering our app.

### React-query

React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for React, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze.

### TypeScript

TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types.

By understanding JavaScript, TypeScript saves you time catching errors and providing fixes before you run code.

### Material UI

Material UI allows us to use pre-defined UI components that look and feel great.
