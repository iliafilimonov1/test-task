## Technologies used

This project follows a custom structure that combines the following:

- [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for extending JavaScript to be typed.
- [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) as the view layer of the app;
- [`Material-ui`](https://mui.com/) as the UI library;
- [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

... and some [more stuff](./package.json).

### React

We use React as a framework for building & rendering our app.

### TypeScript

TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types.

By understanding JavaScript, TypeScript saves you time catching errors and providing fixes before you run code.

### Material UI

Material UI allows us to use pre-defined UI components that look and feel great.
